# Advent Of Code - Python One-Liner Challenge

A fun way of making the Advent of Code a little more challenging and also a fun way to learn some intracacies of the python language! For an example of what is ok, see the day 1 solution. I have done several of them already, so spoilers in the individual folders!

Rules:

- Reading input into a variable from another file or with an assignment is acceptable and does not count against your total for lines.
- Your solution must take the form of 'print INSERT_CODE_HERE'
- Formatting your print with a format string is acceptable so long as you are only substituting ONE value (multiple calculations are not allowed)
- No global variables (outside of the input variable)
